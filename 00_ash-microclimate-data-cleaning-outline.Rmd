Data cleaning steps
1) import the tree data csv file

  - import dates as.date
2) import the sensor datafiles

 - import dates as.date
 
3) check if sensors were turned off during morning of day 3 (Sep 20)
 
 4) combine all data into 1 spreadsheet

 - each row is temperature measurement at a given minute
 
 
```{r-import-data}

# import the data from each sensor
