Data cleaning steps
1) import the tree data csv file
  - check that the classes are correct for numbers and factors
  - import dates as.date
2) import the sensor datafiles
 - check that the classes are correct for numbers and factors
 - import dates as.date
 
3) check if sensors were turned off during morning of day 3 (Sep 20)
 
 4) combine all data into 1 spreadsheet
 - column names ()
 - each row is temperature measurement at a given minute
 
 
```{r-import-data}

# import the data from each sensor

dat86 <- read.csv("data/SN 20397886 2018-09-26 10_27_32 -0600.csv", header = TRUE)

# We can't open these CSV files because the headers aren't formated correctly

# so instead we add some code to modify how to open it
sensor_100e_1 <- read.csv("data/SN 20439121 2018-09-20 00_06_33 -0600.csv", skip = 1, header = TRUE, col.names = c("date_time", "tempF", "sensor_name", "blank1", "blank2", "blank3"))
sensor_100e_1$blank1 <- NULL # Remove the blank columns
sensor_100e_1$blank2 <- NULL # Remove the blank columns
sensor_100e_1$blank3 <- NULL # Remove the blank columns
sensor_100e_1$sensor_name <- rep("ash_removal_100e") 

# check the structure of how it is loaded
str(sensor_100e_1) # we will eventually want date to be formated as date, but number for temp and character for sensor name look good

# could create a loop to do this for all the files in the temp data folder


```
 
```{r-bind-into-1-csv}

# use the commands rbind() to aggregate into 1 dataframe


```
 
```{r-format-date-time}

as.date()

```
