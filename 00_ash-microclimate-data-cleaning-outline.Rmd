Data cleaning steps
1) import the tree data csv file
  - check that the classes are correct for numbers and factors
  - import dates as.date
2) import the sensor datafiles
 - check that the classes are correct for numbers and factors
 - import dates as.date
 
3) check if sensors were turned off during morning of day 3 (Sep 20)
 
 4) combine all data into 1 spreadsheet
 - column names ()
 - each row is temperature measurement at a given minute
