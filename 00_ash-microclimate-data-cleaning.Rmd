Data cleaning steps
1) import the tree data csv file
  - check that the classes are correct for numbers and factors
  - import dates as.date
2) import the sensor datafiles
 - check that the classes are correct for numbers and factors
 - import dates as.date
 
3) check if sensors were turned off during morning of day 3 (Sep 20)
 
 4) combine all data into 1 spreadsheet
 - column names ()
 - each row is temperature measurement at a given minute
 
 
```{r import-data}

# import the data from each sensor

# 100E BEFORE

# open the first file of the treatment-tree 100e, from the "before" removal
treatment_100e_before <- read.csv("data/SN 20439121 2018-09-20 00_06_33 -0600.csv", # define the file name
                          skip = 1, # skip reading the first row
                          header = TRUE, # define the second row as the header
                          col.names = c("date_time", "tempF", "sensor_name", "ash_removal", "blank1",  "blank2")) # rename the columns

treatment_100e_before$blank1 <- NULL # Remove the blank columns
treatment_100e_before$blank2 <- NULL # Remove the blank columns

treatment_100e_before$sensor_name <- rep("treatment_100e") # fill column with the sensor name
treatment_100e_before$ash_removal <- rep("before_removal") # fill the column with the ash removal status

# remove empty rows
treatment_100e_before <- treatment_100e_before[1:4325,]

# check the first 6 rows to see if the dataframe looks as we expect
head(treatment_100e_before)

# check the structure of how it is loaded
str(treatment_100e_before) # we will eventually want date to be formated as date, but for now having number for temp and character for sensor name look good

#-----------------------------------------------------
# 100E AFTER

# open the first file of the treatment-tree 100e, from the "before" removal
treatment_100e_after <- read.csv("data/SN 20439121 2018-09-26 10_27_52 -0600.csv", 
                          skip = 1, header = TRUE, col.names = c("date_time", "tempF", "sensor_name", "ash_removal", "blank1",  "blank2")) 

treatment_100e_after$blank1 <- NULL 
treatment_100e_after$blank2 <- NULL 

treatment_100e_after$sensor_name <- rep("treatment_100e") 
treatment_100e_after$ash_removal <- rep("after_removal") 

# remove empty rows
treatment_100e_after <- treatment_100e_after[1:5502,]

# check the first 6 rows 
head(treatment_100e_after)

# check the structure 
str(treatment_100e_after)
